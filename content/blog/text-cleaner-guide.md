# How to Clean and Format Text Online

Messy text is everywhere — copied from PDFs, emails, spreadsheets, and web pages. Extra spaces, random line breaks, hidden characters, and inconsistent formatting waste time when you are trying to use that text somewhere else.

## How to Use the Text Cleaner

1. Open the [FlipMyCase Text Cleaner](/text-cleaner).
2. Paste your messy text.
3. Toggle the cleaning options you need.
4. Copy the cleaned result.

## What the Text Cleaner Fixes

- **Extra spaces**: Multiple spaces collapsed to one
- **Leading/trailing whitespace**: Trimmed from every line
- **Blank lines**: Empty lines removed
- **Line breaks**: Joined into paragraphs or normalized
- **HTML tags**: Stripped to plain text
- **Special characters**: Smart quotes, em dashes, and other Word artifacts normalized

## Common Scenarios

### Text Copied from PDFs
PDFs break lines at arbitrary points based on page width. A single paragraph might have 10 line breaks in the middle of sentences. The Text Cleaner joins these back into proper paragraphs.

### Data from Spreadsheets
When copying columns from Excel or Google Sheets, you often get trailing spaces, inconsistent whitespace, and hidden tab characters. The Text Cleaner normalizes all of it.

### Web Page Content
Copying text from websites often brings along HTML formatting, non-breaking spaces (&amp;nbsp;), and zero-width characters. The Text Cleaner strips these invisible characters.

### Email Chains
Forwarded email threads accumulate `>` characters, extra blank lines, and messy formatting. Clean it all in one paste.

## Why Clean Text Matters

Dirty text causes real problems: extra spaces break exact-match searches in databases, hidden characters cause code errors, and inconsistent formatting makes documents look unprofessional. Taking 5 seconds to clean your text saves debugging time later.
