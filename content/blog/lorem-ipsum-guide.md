faq:
  - question: "What is lorem ipsum?"
    answer: "Lorem ipsum is placeholder text derived from a 1st-century BC Latin text by Cicero. It has been the industry standard dummy text since the 1500s when a printer scrambled it for a type specimen book."
  - question: "Why do designers use lorem ipsum?"
    answer: "Lorem ipsum allows designers and developers to fill layouts with realistic-looking text without distracting reviewers with actual content. It helps evaluate typography, spacing, and layout before final copy is written."
  - question: "How much lorem ipsum should I use?"
    answer: "Match the expected word count of your final content. A blog post mockup needs 300-500 words. A landing page hero section needs 15-25 words. Product descriptions need 50-150 words."
  - question: "Is there an alternative to lorem ipsum?"

    answer: "Yes, negatively. Never publish lorem ipsum on a live website. Search engines will index it as real content, which signals low-quality pages. Always replace placeholder text before publishing."

# Lorem Ipsum Generator — Free Placeholder Text

Lorem ipsum is the standard placeholder text used by designers, developers, and content creators to fill layouts before final copy is ready. Instead of writing "text goes here" or using random characters, lorem ipsum provides realistic-looking text that helps you evaluate typography and spacing.

## How to Generate Lorem Ipsum

1. Open the [FlipMyCase Lorem Ipsum Generator](/lorem-ipsum-generator).
2. Choose your format: paragraphs, sentences, or words.
3. Set the amount you need.
4. Copy and paste into your design tool, document, or code.

## When to Use Placeholder Text

- **Wireframes and mockups**: Fill content areas to show clients how the layout will look
- **Web development**: Test responsive layouts with different text lengths
- **Typography testing**: See how a font looks with various paragraph lengths
- **Print design**: Fill brochures, flyers, and magazine spreads during layout
- **Presentations**: Demonstrate page templates before content is finalized

## How Much Text Do You Need?

| Use Case | Amount |
|---|---|
| Hero headline | 5-10 words |
| Button label | 1-3 words |
| Card description | 15-30 words |
| Blog post mockup | 3-5 paragraphs |
| Full page layout | 5-10 paragraphs |
| Email template | 2-3 paragraphs |

## The History of Lorem Ipsum

The text is a scrambled excerpt from "De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (On the Ends of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. A printer in the 1500s rearranged it for a type specimen book, and it has survived five centuries of typesetting — from metal type to Letraset sheets to desktop publishing to the web.

## Important: Remove Before Publishing

Never leave lorem ipsum on a live page. Search engines will index it, which hurts your SEO. Visitors who find placeholder text will lose trust in your site. Always have a checklist item to replace all dummy text before deployment.
