# Free Word Counter Tool — Words, Characters, Reading Time

A word counter helps writers, students, and marketers track the length of their text. Whether you are writing an essay, blog post, social media caption, or email, knowing your word count matters.

## How to Use the Word Counter

2. Paste or type your text.
3. See live stats: words, characters, sentences, paragraphs, and reading time.

All processing happens in your browser. Your text is never uploaded.

## What the Word Counter Tracks

- **Words**: Split by whitespace, accurate for English and most Latin-script languages
- **Characters (with spaces)**: Total characters including spaces
- **Characters (no spaces)**: Useful for SMS limits and Twitter/X
- **Sentences**: Counted by period, exclamation mark, and question mark
- **Paragraphs**: Counted by line breaks
- **Reading time**: Based on 200-250 words per minute average

## Common Word Count Requirements
