# Title Case Converter — Rules, Examples, and Free Tool

Title case is the standard capitalization style for headings, book titles, article headlines, and navigation labels. It capitalizes major words while keeping minor words lowercase.

2. Paste your heading or title.
3. Copy the Title Case output.
4. Use it in your document, blog, or presentation.

## Title Case Rules

**Always capitalize:**
- The first and last word
- Nouns (dog, city, report)
- Verbs (is, run, write)
- Adjectives (big, red, important)
- Adverbs (quickly, very, well)
- Pronouns (he, she, it, they)

**Keep lowercase** (unless first or last word):
- Articles: a, an, the
- Short prepositions: in, on, at, to, by, for, of, up
- Conjunctions: and, but, or, nor, yet, so

## Examples

| Input | Title Case |
|---|---|
| the quick brown fox | The Quick Brown Fox |
| war and peace | War and Peace |
| a tale of two cities | A Tale of Two Cities |
| what to do in an emergency | What to Do in an Emergency |

## Style Guide Differences

Different style guides have slightly different rules:

- **AP Style**: Capitalize words of 4+ letters. "With" is capitalized, "for" is not.
- **Chicago Manual of Style**: Similar to AP but with more specific preposition rules.
- **APA Style**: Capitalize words of 4+ letters in titles, 3+ letters in headings.

FlipMyCase uses a widely accepted standard that works across most contexts.

## Title Case for SEO

Search engines do not give ranking preference to title case vs sentence case. However, title case tends to look more authoritative in search results, which can improve click-through rates. Most top-ranking pages use title case for their page titles and H1 tags.
