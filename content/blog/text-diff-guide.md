faq:
  - question: "How do I compare two texts online?"
    answer: "Paste your original text on the left and modified text on the right in the FlipMyCase Text Diff tool. Differences are highlighted instantly with word-level precision."
  - question: "What is word-level diff?"
    answer: "Word-level diff highlights the specific words that changed within a line, not just the entire line. This makes it easier to spot small edits in long paragraphs. Most free diff tools only offer line-level comparison."
  - question: "What is the difference between split and inline view?"
    answer: "Split view shows original and modified texts side by side. Inline view merges them into a single column with additions in green and deletions in red. Split is better for long files; inline is better for quick reviews."
  - question: "Can I ignore case differences?"
    answer: "Yes, toggle the 'Ignore case' option to treat uppercase and lowercase as the same. Useful when comparing text where capitalization varies but content is the same."
  - question: "Can I ignore whitespace differences?"
    answer: "Yes, toggle 'Ignore whitespace' to skip differences caused by extra spaces, tabs, or trailing whitespace. This is especially useful for comparing code."
  - question: "Is this like Diffchecker?"
    answer: "Similar, but FlipMyCase gives you word-level diff, collapse mode, and diff navigation for free. Diffchecker charges for these features in their Pro plan."

# How to Compare Two Texts and Find Differences

Comparing two versions of text is something developers, writers, and editors do constantly. Whether you are reviewing code changes, checking document revisions, or verifying translations, a diff tool shows you exactly what changed.

## How to Use the Text Diff Tool

1. Open the [FlipMyCase Text Diff](/text-diff).
2. Paste the original text on the left.
3. Paste the modified text on the right.
4. View highlighted differences instantly.
5. Use Prev/Next buttons to navigate between changes.

## Features That Set This Apart

### Word-Level Highlighting
Most free diff tools highlight entire lines as changed. FlipMyCase highlights the specific words that differ within each line. This is critical when a single word changes in a long paragraph — you see exactly what changed without scanning the entire line.

### Split and Inline Views
Switch between side-by-side (split) view for detailed comparison and unified (inline) view for a compact overview. Both views include line numbers and word-level highlighting.

### Focus Mode
Collapse unchanged lines to focus only on the differences. When comparing large documents with small changes, this eliminates scrolling through identical content.

### Diff Navigation
Jump between changes using Prev/Next buttons with a counter showing "Change 3 of 12". The view auto-scrolls to each change.

### Similarity Score
See how similar the two texts are as a percentage. Useful for plagiarism checks, translation verification, and tracking how much a document has changed.

## Use Cases

### Code Review
Compare two versions of a function to see what a colleague changed. Word-level diff catches renamed variables and modified conditions.

### Document Editing
Send a draft to an editor, then compare the returned version to see every change made. Faster than using Word's track changes for simple text.

### Configuration Debugging
Compare your development config with production config to find the setting that is causing different behavior.

### Translation Verification
Compare source text with back-translated text to check that meaning was preserved.

### Contract Review
Compare two versions of a contract to identify every changed clause, added paragraph, or removed condition.

## Ignoring Trivial Differences

Toggle **Ignore case** when comparing content where capitalization varies but meaning is the same. Toggle **Ignore whitespace** when comparing code that may have different indentation styles. These options reduce noise and let you focus on meaningful changes.
